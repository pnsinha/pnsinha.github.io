Parmanand Sinha is a Computational Scientist at the Research Computing Center
(RCC) at the University of Chicago. At RCC, he serves as an expert for
geocomputation and spatial modeling. His research interests include urban
economics, cyberGIS, spatial data-mining, and spatial econometrics. Parmanand
completed M. S. and Ph.D. in Geospatial Information Sciences at the University
of Texas at Dallas under the supervision of Dr. Daniel Griffith. He holds a
Bachelor of Architecture degree from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.
Previously as a postdoctoral assistant, he has worked at the University of
Louisville on the WorldPop project, and with the Spatial Sciences Census
Research group at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
